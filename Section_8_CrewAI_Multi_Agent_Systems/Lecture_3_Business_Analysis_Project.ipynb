    "Welcome to the final lecture of Section 7! You’ve learned about multi-agent systems, explored AutoGen, and got hands-on with CrewAI to automate customer support. Now, it’s time to put it all together in a capstone project. In this notebook, you’ll build a multi-agent system using CrewAI to analyze business data and generate a sales report—a real-world task that can save your team hours and help you make smarter decisions."
