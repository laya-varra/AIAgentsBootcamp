    "**Business Case**: TechCorp's IT team receives 30+ daily support tickets, with 70% being routine issues like password resets and VPN problems. This creates delays and prevents the IT team from focusing on strategic work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Solution**: Build an AI-powered chatbot using LangChain that can handle routine IT support questions instantly, escalate complex issues appropriately, and provide 24/7 basic support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals**: \n",
    "- Master LangChain core components (Prompt Templates, LLMs, Chains, Memory)\n",
    "- Build a practical business application\n",
    "- Demonstrate real-world problem solving with AI"

      "\n",
      "1. Open the TechCorp VPN app on your device (smartphone, tablet, or laptop).\n",
      "2. Make sure you're connected to the correct Wi-Fi network. You can check this by looking at the top bar of your screen and ensuring it says \"TechCorp VPN\" or a similar name.\n",
      "3. Tap the \"Connect\" button in the VPN app. If you've already connected, try disconnecting and then reconnecting again.\n",
      "4. Wait for the VPN to establish a connection. This may take a few seconds. You'll know it's working when you see a checkmark next to your username or profile picture.\n",
      "5. Once connected, you should be able to access TechCorp's internal networks and resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're still having trouble connecting, here are some additional troubleshooting steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Ensure that your device's location is set to the correct country/region for TechCorp's VPN server.\n",

      "* Try restarting your device and then reconnecting to the VPN.\n",
      "\n",
      "If none of these steps work, I need to escalate this to our IT team. The reason for escalation is that a persistent VPN connection issue may indicate a more complex problem with our network infrastructure or your device configuration.
