# System Architecture

## 1. Overview
DataFlow Solutions’ cloud-based BI and data visualization platform is built on a scalable, secure, multi-tenant architecture hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Launched in 2019, the platform serves 5,000+ customers across 40+ countries, processing ~1TB of data daily for dashboards, reports, and real-time analytics (customer_analytics.csv). This document details the infrastructure, supporting engineering, DevOps, and technical stakeholders in maintaining a 99.9% uptime SLA (billing_and_pricing.csv).

The architecture leverages microservices, Kubernetes orchestration, and PostgreSQL databases to deliver features like drag-and-drop dashboards, API integrations, and white-labeling (product_user_guide.md). Security is enforced per security_policies.txt, and compliance aligns with SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and HIPAA (compliance_certifications.csv).

## 2. Database Schemas and Relationships
DataFlow uses PostgreSQL 14.5 for transactional data and Amazon Redshift for analytics, with a multi-tenant schema to isolate customer data.

### 2.1 Core Schemas
- **Users**:
  - Table: `users`
  - Columns: `user_id (UUID, PK)`, `email (VARCHAR)`, `plan_type (ENUM: Starter, Professional, Enterprise)`, `created_at (TIMESTAMP)`, `tenant_id (UUID)`
  - Purpose: Stores user accounts (product_user_guide.md, Section 2).
- **Dashboards**:
  - Table: `dashboards`
  - Columns: `dashboard_id (UUID, PK)`, `user_id (UUID, FK)`, `name (VARCHAR)`, `config (JSONB)`, `updated_at (TIMESTAMP)`, `tenant_id (UUID)`
  - Purpose: Stores dashboard configurations (product_user_guide.md, Section 4).
- **Data Sources**:
  - Table: `data_sources`
  - Columns: `ds_id (UUID, PK)`, `tenant_id (UUID)`, `type (ENUM: SQL, API, CSV)`, `connection (JSONB, encrypted)`, `last_updated (TIMESTAMP)`
  - Purpose: Manages connections (product_user_guide.md, Section 3).
- **Reports**:
  - Table: `reports`
  - Columns: `report_id (UUID, PK)`, `dashboard_id (UUID, FK)`, `format (ENUM: PDF, CSV)`, `status (ENUM: Pending, Completed)`, `download_url (VARCHAR)`
  - Purpose: Stores scheduled reports (api_documentation.json, /reports).

### 2.2 Relationships
- `users` 1:N `dashboards` (user_id FK).
- `dashboards` 1:N `reports` (dashboard_id FK).
- `data_sources` N:M `dashboards` via junction table `dashboard_data_sources`.
- Tenant isolation via `tenant_id` ensures data separation (privacy_policy.txt).

### 2.3 Metrics
- Database Size: ~500GB across 5,000 tenants.
- Query Latency: 200ms average (Redshift for analytics, PostgreSQL for transactions).
- Sharding: By `tenant_id` for scalability (Customer 1003, customer_analytics.csv, with 50 dashboards).

Edge Case: Healthcare customers (Customer 1039, customer_analytics.csv) require dedicated schemas for HIPAA compliance (compliance_certifications.csv).
Use Case: Customer 1001’s retail dashboard (customer_analytics.csv) queries `dashboards` and `data_sources` for real-time sales (product_user_guide.md, Section 5.3).
