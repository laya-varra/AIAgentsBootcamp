# Customer Support Procedures

## 1. Overview
This document outlines standardized procedures for DataFlow Solutions’ customer support team to deliver high-quality, consistent support to 5,000+ customers across 40+ countries (customer_analytics.csv). Effective support drives customer satisfaction (target: 4.5/5, customer_analytics.csv) and retention, aligning with our mission to empower businesses (employee_handbook.txt, Section 1). Procedures cover ticket management, SLAs, escalations, communication, refunds, troubleshooting, surveys, and knowledge base maintenance.

For customer-facing resources, see product_user_guide.md and troubleshooting_guide.txt. For emergencies, see incident_response_playbook.txt. Contact support@dataflow.com or +1-800-555-1234 for internal escalation.

---

## 2. Ticket Priority Classification
Tickets are classified P0–P3 based on impact and urgency, ensuring critical issues are resolved first.

### 2.1 Priority Levels
- **P0: Critical Outage**
  - Impact: Platform-wide failure (e.g., API unavailable, all dashboards down).
  - Example: Customer 1003 (customer_analytics.csv) reports “Error 503: Service Unavailable” (troubleshooting_guide.txt, DB-2002).
  - Response Time: 1 hour (billing_and_pricing.csv, Enterprise SLA).
- **P1: High Impact**
  - Impact: Major feature unusable (e.g., data source connection failure, SSO login issue).
  - Example: Customer 1001 (customer_analytics.csv) reports “DS-1001: Invalid Credentials” (troubleshooting_guide.txt).
  - Response Time: 4 hours (Enterprise), 12 hours (Professional), 24 hours (Starter).
- **P2: Moderate Impact**
  - Impact: Minor feature issue or workaround available (e.g., slow dashboard, mobile app error).
  - Example: Customer 1017 (customer_analytics.csv) reports “MOB-6006: App Not Loading” (troubleshooting_guide.txt).
  - Response Time: 12 hours (Enterprise), 24 hours (Professional), 48 hours (Starter).
- **P3: Low Impact**
  - Impact: Non-critical (e.g., UI bug, feature request).
  - Example: Customer 1011 (customer_analytics.csv) reports “Comments not loading” (troubleshooting_guide.txt, COL-11001).
  - Response Time: 24 hours (Enterprise), 48 hours (Professional), 72 hours (Starter).

### 2.2 Classification Process
1. Log ticket in Zendesk with customer details (plan type, customer ID from customer_analytics.csv).
2. Assess impact using error codes (troubleshooting_guide.txt) and plan SLAs (billing_and_pricing.csv).
3. Assign priority (P0–P3) within 15 minutes of receipt.
4. Notify customer with initial response (Section 5).

**Edge Case**: If priority is unclear (e.g., partial outage affecting multiple customers), escalate to Support Manager within 30 minutes (Section 4).

**Use Case**: Customer 1006 (customer_analytics.csv) reports “API-4004: Too Many Requests” (troubleshooting_guide.txt), classified as P1 due to integration dependency.

---

## 3. Response Time SLAs
SLAs ensure timely responses based on customer plan (billing_and_pricing.csv).

### 3.1 SLA Details
| Plan       | P0   | P1   | P2   | P3   |
|------------|------|------|------|------|
| Starter    | 1 hr | 24 hr| 48 hr| 72 hr|
| Professional | 1 hr | 12 hr| 24 hr| 48 hr|
| Enterprise | 1 hr | 4 hr | 12 hr| 24 hr|

- **First Response**: Acknowledge ticket with estimated resolution time.
- **Resolution Target**: 80% of P0–P1 tickets resolved within 24 hours, P2–P3 within 72 hours.
- **Metrics**: Track in Zendesk (95% SLA compliance, customer_analytics.csv, Satisfaction_Score).

### 3.2 SLA Monitoring
- Real-time dashboard tracks ticket status (system_architecture.md, Monitoring).
- Weekly reports to Support Managers (target: <5% SLA breaches).
- Notify customers if SLA breach occurs (Section 5, Template 3).

**Edge Case**: For international customers (e.g., UK, Customer 1009, customer_analytics.csv), adjust response times for time zones (e.g., 4-hour P1 SLA starts at 9 AM GMT).

**Use Case**: Customer 1018 (customer_analytics.csv) on Enterprise plan receives a 4-hour P1 response for “SSO-9001: Login Failure” (troubleshooting_guide.txt).

---

## 4. Escalation Procedures
Escalate unresolved or critical issues to engineering, product, or leadership teams.

### 4.1 Escalation Paths
- **P0 (Outage)**:
  - Escalate to DevOps within 30 minutes via Slack #incident-channel (incident_response_playbook.txt).
  - Notify CTO and Support Director.
  - Example: Customer 1036 (customer_analytics.csv) reports platform outage (DB-2002).
- **P1 (Major Issue)**:
  - Escalate to Engineering within 2 hours if unresolved (Zendesk > Jira integration, system_architecture.md).
  - Notify Support Manager.
  - Example: Customer 1001 (customer_analytics.csv) reports persistent DS-1001.
- **P2–P3 (Minor/Feature)**:
  - Escalate to Product Team for bugs or requests within 24 hours (Jira ticket).
  - Example: Customer 1023 (customer_analytics.csv) requests map widget fix (MOB-6007).

### 4.2 Process
1. Document issue details (error code, customer ID, steps to reproduce) in Zendesk.
2. Assign to escalation queue with priority tag.
3. Notify customer of escalation (Section 5, Template 2).
4. Track resolution in Jira (real-time updates, system_architecture.md).
5. Update customer upon resolution (Section 5, Template 1).

### 4.3 Metrics
- Escalation Rate: <10% of tickets (Zendesk).
- Resolution Time: P0 <4 hours, P1 <24 hours, P2–P3 <5 days.
- Customer Satisfaction: 4.5/5 post-escalation (customer_analytics.csv).

**Edge Case**: For multi-customer P0 issues (e.g., API outage affecting 100+ customers), follow incident_response_playbook.txt and notify all via status.dataflow.com.

**Use Case**: Customer 1004 (customer_analytics.csv) escalates “DB-2003: Slow Loading” (troubleshooting_guide.txt) to Engineering, resolved by optimizing queries.
