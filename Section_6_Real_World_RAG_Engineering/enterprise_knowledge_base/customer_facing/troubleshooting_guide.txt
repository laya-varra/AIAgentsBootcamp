1. Unable to Connect to Data Source
Error Code: DS-1001
Error Message: "Connection failed: Invalid credentials or host unreachable"
Description: Occurs when connecting to SQL databases, APIs, or cloud storage (product_user_guide.md, Section 3).
Possible Causes:
- Incorrect connection string (e.g., wrong host or port).
- Database server down or unreachable.
- Firewall blocking DataFlow’s IP range.
- Invalid or expired credentials.
Solutions:
1. Verify connection string in Data Sources settings (product_user_guide.md, Section 3.1 for SQL, 3.2 for APIs).
2. Check server status with your IT team or provider (e.g., AWS RDS, Salesforce).
3. Ensure firewall allows DataFlow’s IP range (security_policies.txt, Network Security).
4. Re-enter credentials and test connection.
5. For APIs, refresh keys in the source system (integration_partners.csv, e.g., Salesforce).
6. If unresolved, escalate to support@dataflow.com (customer_support_procedures.md, P1 ticket).
Use Case: Customer 1001 (customer_analytics.csv) reported DS-1001 when connecting to MySQL due to an expired password.
Edge Case: For large databases (>10GB), ensure query timeouts are adjusted (system_architecture.md, Data Pipeline).
