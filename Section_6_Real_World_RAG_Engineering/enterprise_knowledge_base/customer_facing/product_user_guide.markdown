## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Account Creation
To begin, create an account based on your plan (Starter, Professional, Enterprise; see `billing_and_pricing.csv`).

**Steps**:
1. Visit [DataFlow Signup](https://www.dataflow.com/signup).
2. Enter your email, company name, and password (12+ characters, per `security_policies.txt`).
3. For Enterprise plans, enable Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML 2.0 (see `security_policies.txt`).
4. Verify your email with the confirmation link.
5. Accept the Terms of Service (see `terms_of_service.md`).

**Edge Case**: If the verification email isn’t received, check spam or request a resend. For SSO issues, contact your IT admin or support@dataflow.com (see `troubleshooting_guide.txt`, Error DS-1001).

### 2.2 First Login
Access the platform at [DataFlow Login](https://app.dataflow.com).

**Steps**:
1. Enter your email and password or use SSO (Enterprise).
2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for security (mandatory per `security_policies.txt`).
3. Complete the onboarding wizard to set preferences (e.g., time zone, currency).

**Power User Tip**: Use Ctrl+L to quickly access the login screen. For browser compatibility, use Chrome or Firefox (see `troubleshooting_guide.txt`, Browser Issues).

### 2.3 Interface Overview
The DataFlow interface includes:
- **Dashboards**: View and create dashboards.
- **Data Sources**: Manage connections (SQL, APIs, CSV).
- **Reports**: Generate and schedule reports.
- **Settings**: Configure account, permissions, and integrations.

## 3. Connecting to Data Sources

DataFlow supports multiple data sources, including SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), APIs, CSV uploads, and cloud storage (Google Drive, AWS S3). See `integration_partners.csv` for supported integrations.

### 3.1 SQL Database Connection
Connect to MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server databases.

**Steps**:
1. Go to “Data Sources” > “Add New Data Source.”
2. Select “SQL Database” and choose your database type.
3. Enter connection details:
   - Host (e.g., db.example.com)
   - Port (e.g., 3306 for MySQL)
   - Database name
   - Username and password (encrypted per `privacy_policy.txt`)
4. Test the connection.
5. Save and name the data source (e.g., “Sales DB”).

**Edge Case**: For large databases (>10GB), optimize queries to avoid timeouts (see `troubleshooting_guide.txt`, Error DR-3003). Ensure firewall allows DataFlow’s IP range (per `security_policies.txt`).

### 3.2 API Connections
Integrate with third-party APIs (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot; see `integration_partners.csv`).

**Steps**:
1. Select “API” in “Add New Data Source.”
2. Enter the API endpoint URL (e.g., https://api.salesforce.com/v1).
3. Provide authentication (API key or OAuth 2.0; see `api_documentation.json`, Authentication).
4. Map response fields to DataFlow columns.
5. Test and save.

**Edge Case**: If the API key expires, refresh it in the source system and update DataFlow (see `troubleshooting_guide.txt`, Error API-4004).

### 3.3 CSV Uploads
Upload CSV files for quick analysis.

**Steps**:
1. Select “CSV Upload” in “Add New Data Source.”
2. Drag and drop or browse to upload the file (max 500MB for Starter, unlimited for Enterprise; see `billing_and_pricing.csv`).
3. Map columns to data types (e.g., Date, Number, Text).
4. Validate data (e.g., check for missing values).
5. Save as a data source.

**Edge Case**: For files >100MB, use cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive) to avoid upload timeouts (see `integration_partners.csv`).

**Power User Tip**: Schedule CSV imports via API for automation (see `api_documentation.json`, /datasources/import).

## 4. Creating Dashboards

Dashboards are interactive visualizations of your data. The Dashboard Builder offers drag-and-drop functionality for creating custom layouts.

### 4.1 Starting a Dashboard
**Steps**:
1. Go to “Dashboards” > “Create New.”
2. Choose a template (e.g., Sales, Marketing) or start from scratch.
3. Name the dashboard (e.g., “Q2 Sales Performance”).
4. Select a data source (e.g., “Sales DB” from Section 3.1).

[Screenshot: Dashboard Builder Interface]

### 4.2 Adding Widgets
Widgets include charts, tables, text boxes, and maps.

**Steps**:
1. Drag a widget from the toolbar (e.g., Bar Chart).
2. Bind it to a data source field (e.g., Sales_Amount).
3. Configure settings (e.g., aggregation: Sum, filter: Q2 2025).
4. Resize and position the widget.

**Example: Retail Sales Dashboard**:
- **Bar Chart**: Monthly sales by product category (data: Sales DB, field: Sales_Amount).
- **Line Chart**: Sales trends over 12 months (data: Sales DB, field: Date).
- **Table**: Top 10 products by revenue (data: Sales DB, fields: Product, Revenue).
- **Map**: Sales by region (data: Sales DB, field: Region, added in v2.4.1; see `release_notes.json`).

[Screenshot: Retail Sales Dashboard]

### 4.3 Edge Cases
- **Large Datasets**: For >1M rows, enable data sampling to improve performance (see `troubleshooting_guide.txt`, Error DB-2002).
- **Complex Joins**: Use calculated fields for multi-table joins (Section 8.1).
- **Real-Time Data**: Ensure data source supports streaming (e.g., Kafka; see `system_architecture.md`).

**Power User Tip**: Use Ctrl+D to duplicate widgets. Save dashboards with Ctrl+S.

## 5. Visualization Types

DataFlow offers a variety of visualizations, each suited for specific use cases.

### 5.1 Charts
- **Bar Chart**: Compare categories (e.g., sales by region).
- **Line Chart**: Show trends (e.g., revenue over time).
- **Pie Chart**: Display proportions (e.g., market share by product).
- **Area Chart**: Highlight cumulative trends (e.g., website traffic).

**Use Case**: A retail analyst uses a bar chart to compare Q2 sales across stores (see Section 4.2 example).

### 5.2 Tables
- Display raw or aggregated data with sorting and filtering.
- **Use Case**: A manager creates a table of top customers by lifetime value, sorted by revenue.

### 5.3 Maps
- Visualize geographic data with heatmaps, pins, or choropleth maps (added in v2.4.1; see `release_notes.json`).
- **Use Case**: A healthcare executive maps patient distribution by state for resource allocation.

### 5.4 Gauges and KPIs
- Show single metrics (e.g., current month sales vs. target).
- **Use Case**: An executive tracks real-time revenue against quarterly goals.

**Power User Tip**: Combine visualizations in a single dashboard for holistic insights (e.g., map + table for regional sales analysis).

## 6. Collaboration and Sharing

DataFlow enables team collaboration through sharing, commenting, and permissions.

### 6.1 Sharing Dashboards
**Steps**:
1. Open a dashboard and click “Share.”
2. Generate a link (view-only or editable).
3. For Enterprise plans, embed dashboards in external apps (e.g., intranet; see `billing_and_pricing.csv`).
4. Send via email or copy the link.

**Edge Case**: Links expire after 30 days unless set to “Permanent” (Enterprise only). Revoke access in Settings if needed.

### 6.2 Permissions
- **View-Only**: Users can see but not edit (Starter and above).
- **Edit**: Users can modify widgets and data bindings (Professional and Enterprise).
- **Admin**: Full control, including deletion (Enterprise only).

**Steps**:
1. Go to “Settings” > “Permissions.”
2. Add team members by email or SSO group.
3. Assign roles (View, Edit, Admin).

**Edge Case**: If a user lacks access, verify their plan limits (see `billing_and_pricing.csv`) or check `troubleshooting_guide.txt`, Error PERM-5005.

### 6.3 Commenting
- Add annotations to widgets for collaboration.
- **Steps**:
  1. Click a widget and select “Comment.”
  2. Type your note (e.g., “Verify Q2 data with finance”).
  3. Tag team members with @username.

**Use Case**: A manager comments on a sales dashboard to request data validation, tagging the analyst.

**Power User Tip**: Use Ctrl+C to open the comment panel. Notifications are sent via email or mobile app (Section 7).
