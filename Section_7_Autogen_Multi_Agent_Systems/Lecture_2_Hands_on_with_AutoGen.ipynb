    "# Section 7, Lecture 3: Hands-on AutoGen: Create AI Agents for Sales Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Lecture 3 of Section 7! In the last lecture, we introduced AutoGen and saw how it can help you build a team of AI agents to tackle business tasks. Now, we’re getting hands-on. In this notebook, you’ll create your own multi-agent system using AutoGen to automate a real-world business task: handling sales queries. By the end, you’ll have a working system that can save your sales team hours of manual work, boosting productivity and keeping your customers happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You’ll Build\n",
    "- A multi-agent system using AutoGen with two agents: a user proxy and an assistant.\n",
    "- A system to automate:\n",
    "  - **User Proxy Agent**: Receives the customer’s query (e.g., “What’s the status of my order?”).\n",
    "  - **Assistant Agent**: Responds with an answer, powered by GPT-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Business\n",
    "Sales queries can take hours of manual work—time your team could spend closing deals. With AutoGen, you’ll automate these tasks, ensuring faster responses, happier customers, and more time for your team to focus on selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started!\n"
