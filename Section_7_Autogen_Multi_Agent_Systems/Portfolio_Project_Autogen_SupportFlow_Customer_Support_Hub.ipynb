    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Specialization**: How did dividing responsibilities among agents improve the solution quality compared to a single agent approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collaboration Patterns**: What did you observe about how agents shared information and built on each other's work in the group chat scenario?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Business Impact**: How would you measure the success of this system in a real deployment? What metrics matter most?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: What additional agents or capabilities would you add for a larger support organization?\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÆ Extension Ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Add emotion detection for frustrated customers\n",
    "- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Connect to real documentation systems  \n",
    "- **Escalation Logic**: Automatic routing to human agents for complex issues\n",
    "- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track performance metrics and customer satisfaction\n",
    "- **Multi-language Support**: Handle tickets in different languages\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Production Deployment Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Integration**: Connect to ticketing systems (Zendesk, Jira)\n",
    "- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and data protection\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Track agent performance and response quality\n",
    "- **Human Oversight**: Build approval workflows for sensitive issues\n",
    "- **Continuous Learning**: Implement feedback loops for improvement"
